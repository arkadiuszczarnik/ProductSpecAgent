Product Spec Agent is a spec-driven product workspace for turning rough ideas into implementation-ready product documentation. It guides product owners, founders, and engineering teams through discovery, scope, decisions, clarifications, feature planning, consistency checks, and AI-coding-agent handoff.

The goal is simple: move from "we have an idea" to a clean, versionable repository of product artifacts that can be used by tools like Codex, Claude Code, and other AI-assisted development workflows.

## Highlights

- **Guided idea-to-spec workflow**: capture product context step by step instead of starting from a blank document.
- **Structured decisions and clarifications**: surface open questions, trade-offs, and blockers early.
- **Feature workbench and cockpit**: keep project readiness, feature status, and next actions visible.
- **Spec, plan, and task artifacts**: generate documents that are useful for both humans and coding agents.
- **Agent-ready handoff**: export repository-ready files for downstream implementation work.
- **Modern full-stack architecture**: Next.js frontend, Kotlin/Spring Boot backend, Koog-powered agent orchestration, JWT auth, and S3-compatible storage.

## Demo Flow

1. Create a project from a rough product idea.
2. Complete the guided wizard for problem, audience, features, MVP, decisions, and review.
3. Use the cockpit to inspect readiness and feature progress.
4. Export specs, plans, tasks, and handoff files for implementation.

## Tech Stack

| Area | Stack |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Rete.js |
| Backend | Kotlin, Java 21, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Validation |
| Agents | JetBrains Koog, OpenAI or Anthropic-compatible model routing |
| Storage | S3-compatible object storage, MinIO for local development |
| Testing | JUnit 5, Mockito Kotlin, Testcontainers, Playwright, ESLint |
| Deployment | Docker Compose, Pulumi infrastructure modules |

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Node.js and npm
- Docker
- An OpenAI API key or compatible Anthropic setup for agent features

### Run the full local stack

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./start.sh
```

This starts:

- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- MinIO console: `http://localhost:9001`

`start.sh` also provisions the local MinIO bucket and sets development defaults for S3, auth, and model routing.

### Run services manually

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
./gradlew bootRun --quiet
```

```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

Common environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Enables OpenAI-backed Koog agents |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Selects `openai` or `claude` defaults in `start.sh` |
| `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret |
| `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated admin allowlist, `*` in local dev |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` | S3 endpoint, local MinIO by default |
| `S3_BUCKET` | Object storage bucket |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` | S3 credentials |

For Docker Compose, provide required secrets through `.env`.
